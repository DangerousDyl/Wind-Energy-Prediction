#using recurrent neural networks with keras on a 
#wind turbine power output  forecasting problem.
#using a time series of data points coming from sensors installed
#in a wind turbine farm in turkey in 2018
#variables such as the wind velocity, direction, speed
#power output was recorded and binned at a 10min interval.
#After which, we'll predict what the power output would be 
#24hrs after the last data point in the future.



#In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's 
#like wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. 
#for 10 minutes intervals. This file was taken from a wind 
#turbine's scada system that is working and generating power 
#in Turkey.
#The location is in Turkey, Yalova. The coordinates are X:668478 Y:4494833 UTM ED 50, 6 degree.

#The data's in the file are:

#Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)
#LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
#Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
#Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
#Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)


#The main input is the NWP forecast, usually provided by a national meteorological service. The accuracy of the NWP model is critical in determining the
#overall accuracy of the wind power forecasting system for look-ahead times greater
#than 6 hours. The NWP forecast is dynamic in the sense that it might be provided
#typically every 6 hours, with hourly look-ahead times extending out to 48 hours.


#this problem has the issue associated with time series
#this SHORT-TERM FORECAST are needed power system management or energy trading (wiki)

#three techniques will be used
#recurrent dropout; this uses is dropout technique to fight overfitting
#in recurrent layers

#stacking recurrent layers
#recurrent dropout; at the expense of higher computational loads, this 
#increases the representational power of the network


#bidirectional recurrent layers
#recurrent dropout; this increases the accuracy and reduces forcasting issues
#by presenting the same information to a recurrent network in different ways
